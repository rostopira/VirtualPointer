Remote controls with gyroscope cost a lot and isn't so flexible as smartphone or tablet with touchscreen.

  - Gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer

  - Navigation keys (Back, Home, Recent apps)
  - Dpad, Volume and other keys
  - Text input
  - Autodetect server in LAN

Used code from https://bitbucket.org/apacha/sensor-fusion-demo
